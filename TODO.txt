GENERAL:

	 * Have miscellaneous stats in the credits at end of mod.
	 * Add highlighting on important entities.
	  * notes
	  * items
	  * interactable entities
	 * Maybe have a sand monster in a later level? Like the Half Life 2 sequence but more linear.
		
	MODULES:
	 * (NOT NECESSARY) Create a fire damage module, that checks if the player is inside of a trigger area ("FirePlayerDamage_X") use Entity_GetCollide(),
