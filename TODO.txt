STORY:
	LOCATION: Africa.
	YEAR: ~1910-1930.
	PROTAGONIST: Arthur.
	
	Dr. Arthur - an epidemiologist - has been assigned to investigate an outbreak of an
	unidentified disease thats been spreading in local populations in northern Africa.
	Arthur has recieved a letter from the local village pastor of the possible location
	of the epidemic - an abandoned fort in the mountains.
	
	These catacombs holds an artifact that lets one traverse to the 
	ruins of an ancient civilzation called [REDACTED]. There is a terrible creature roaming - the ghûl.

GENERAL: CHANGE 01_00_prologue to 01_01_path_to_fort.hpm and make a new prologue map where the player spawns in a tent where the 
	player can read the note that the pastor has written.

	TODO:
	 * In the loading screens ask the player personal questions (refer to them as "you").
	 * Have miscellaneous stats in the credits at end of mod.
	 * Add highlighting on important entities.
	  * notes
	  * items
	  * interactable entities
	 * Maybe have a sand monster in a later level? Like the Half Life 2 sequence but more linear.
		
	MODULES:
	 * (NOT NECESSARY) Create a fire damage module, that checks if the player is inside of a trigger area ("FirePlayerDamage_X") use Entity_GetCollide(), 
	   to get all the trigger areas use Map_GetEntityArray().
 
MAPS: use new_sounds/animations/tank_window_exit for exiting the vehicle

	01_00_prologue: Look for a good microphone, stand, and popfilter.

		LEVEL:
			TODO:
			 
		SCRIPTS:
			TODO:
			 * Add vo throughout the level.
			 * Use the entity corpse_sandmummy.ent (scale: 1.5) and place his head right above the sand and make its body rotate and look at player
			   when player looks away or update its rotation constantly.
